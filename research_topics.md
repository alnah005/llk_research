## Introduction to TT-LLK (Tenstorrent Low-Level Kernel Library)
**Date:** 2026-04-05
**Status:** Completed
**Guide:** introduction_to_tt_llk/
**Why Needed:** Developers and op writers need a comprehensive introduction to the TT-LLK library — the foundational software layer for programming Tenstorrent Tensix cores. The library is header-only C++17 with hardware-specific implementations across three chip architectures (Blackhole, Wormhole B0, Quasar), and understanding its structure, APIs, and programming model is essential for writing efficient kernels. The source code lives at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-llk.
**Questions:**
- What is TT-LLK and where does it sit in the Tenstorrent software stack (relative to TT-Metal and TT-Forge)?
- What is the Tensix Core architecture and how do its 5 RISC-V cores (B, T0, T1, T2, NC) and 3-way threaded coprocessor model work?
- How is data organized (tiles, data formats, L1 memory) and how do unpack/math/pack operations form the core compute pipeline?
- What are the key LLK APIs — eltwise operations, matrix multiply, reduce, transpose — and how are they structured as C++ templates?
- How do the three hardware targets (Blackhole, Wormhole B0, Quasar) differ in their LLK implementations?
- What is the SFPU (Scalar Floating Point Unit) and what operations does it support?
- How does the test infrastructure work and how do developers run and write tests?
- What conventions, data formats (FP32, FP16, BFP8, Int8, etc.), and synchronization mechanisms (DstSync, semaphores) must kernel writers understand?

## TT-LLK Usage in TT-Metal
**Date:** 2026-04-05
**Status:** Completed
**Guide:** tt_llk_usage_in_tt_metal/
**Why Needed:** Understanding how TT-Metal consumes and integrates the TT-LLK library is critical for developers working across the stack. TT-Metal is the higher-level runtime/compiler layer, and TT-LLK provides the low-level kernel primitives it builds on. Mapping the integration points, call patterns, and build-system linkage helps developers understand how to write kernels that work correctly within TT-Metal, and how changes in LLK propagate to the Metal layer. The source code for TT-LLK lives at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-llk and TT-Metal at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-metal.
**Questions:**
- How does TT-Metal reference and include TT-LLK? What is the build-system integration (CMake, submodule, header paths)?
- Which TT-Metal components directly call LLK APIs (e.g., kernel dispatch, op implementations, compute kernels)?
- How does TT-Metal's kernel compilation pipeline use LLK headers — are they compiled per-kernel, per-op, or globally?
- What is the mapping between TT-Metal ops/operations (e.g., matmul, eltwise, reduce) and the underlying LLK API calls?
- How does TT-Metal configure LLK for different hardware targets (Blackhole, Wormhole B0, Quasar)?
- What runtime parameters does TT-Metal pass to LLK kernels, and how are they plumbed through?
- How do TT-Metal's compute kernel source files (the .cpp files that run on Tensix) use LLK includes and macros?
- Are there abstraction layers or wrappers in TT-Metal between the user-facing op API and raw LLK calls?

## Pros and Cons of LLK Integration with TT-Metal
**Date:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Pending
**Why Needed:** TT-Metal consumes TT-LLK as its low-level kernel layer, but the integration design has significant architectural implications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the current integration model — from build system coupling, to API abstraction boundaries, to hardware target configuration, to developer ergonomics — is essential for informing future architectural decisions about how these two layers should evolve together. The source code for TT-LLK lives at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-llk and TT-Metal at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-metal.
**Questions:**
- What are the advantages of the current submodule-based integration model (header inclusion, build-time compilation)?
- What are the disadvantages or pain points (tight coupling, version synchronization, build complexity)?
- How well does the current LLK API abstraction boundary serve TT-Metal op writers? Are there leaky abstractions?
- What are the pros and cons of LLK being header-only vs. a compiled library from TT-Metal's perspective?
- How does the per-architecture code duplication in LLK (wormhole_b0/, blackhole/, quasar/) affect TT-Metal's maintenance burden?
- What are the trade-offs of the current template-heavy API design for kernel compilation time and binary size?
- How well does the current testing strategy work across the LLK/TT-Metal boundary? Are there gaps?
- What alternative integration patterns could address identified weaknesses, and what would their trade-offs be?

## Pros and Cons of Writing TT-Metal Kernels Using LLK
**Date:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Completed
**Guide:** pros_and_cons_of_writing_tt_metal_kernels_using_llk/
**Why Needed:** Kernel authors working in TT-Metal must navigate a multi-layered stack — from host-side op factories through the Compute Kernel API down to raw LLK primitives — to implement new compute kernels. Understanding the strengths and pain points of this current kernel-authoring workflow is essential for improving developer productivity, reducing bugs, and informing API design decisions. This analysis should cover the full authoring experience: the macro system (MATH/PACK/UNPACK), the init/tile pattern, template-heavy APIs, defines-as-configuration, compile-time vs runtime args, SFPU extension patterns, debugging tools, and the per-architecture considerations. The source code for TT-LLK lives at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-llk and TT-Metal at /localdev/salnahari/testing_dir/tt-metal.
**Questions:**
- What are the advantages of the current TRISC macro system (MATH/PACK/UNPACK) for writing compute kernels? What are its pitfalls?
- How well does the Compute Kernel API abstract away LLK complexity? Where does the abstraction leak?
- What are the pros and cons of the defines-as-configuration pattern (host passes preprocessor defines to parameterize kernels)?
- How ergonomic is the init/acquire/compute/commit/wait/pack/release tile processing pattern? What are common mistakes?
- What are the trade-offs of the template-heavy API design for kernel authors (compile times, error messages, flexibility)?
- How effective are the current debugging tools (LLK_ASSERT, fake_kernels_target, generated file inspection) for kernel development?
- What is the experience of adding a new SFPU operation end-to-end? What friction points exist?
- How does per-architecture divergence (especially Quasar) affect kernel portability and developer burden?
- What improvements to the kernel-authoring workflow would have the highest impact on developer productivity?
